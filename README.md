# Escape


ESCAPE is a text-based adventure game where your goal is to break out of the most secure prison in the country. Imprisoned for a crime they did not commit, the player must rely on their wits to break out and redeem themselves. The game starts with the player in his cell, but they are free to roam about and explore the prison, respecting the rules, of course! The player can either rely on their keen observation skills to find out how the prison operates, how the guards behave, etc., or they can try to get in with the other inmates to get information. To keep the prisoners in check, there are alert guards posted at strategic locations.
